# YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing ðŸ“ŠðŸš€

## Introduction

Welcome to the YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing project â€“ an interactive solution for extracting and analyzing insights from YouTube. This project, developed by a sole contributor, utilizes MongoDB and MySQL for data warehousing, offering a user-friendly interface for dynamic data collection and exploration.

## Workflow

1. **Configure Project:**
    - Clone this repository to your local machine.
    - Install required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Set Up Databases:**
    - Create a MySQL database named `youtube_data` manually before running the application. You can use the following SQL query:
      ```sql
      CREATE DATABASE youtube_data;
      ```
    - Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running. No manual database creation is required for MongoDB; the code will create the necessary collections.

3. **User Input:**
    - Run the Streamlit app using `streamlit run app.py`.
    - Enter the total count of YouTube channels you want to analyze.
    - For each channel, a textbox will open. Enter the channel ID for each textbox.

4. **Enable Fetch Details Button:**
    - Once all channel IDs are entered, a "Fetch Details" button will be enabled.

5. **Fetch Details:**
    - Click the "Fetch Details" button to initiate data retrieval.
    - Data will be pulled from the YouTube API and stored in MongoDB.
    - Simultaneously, the data will be pushed to MySQL for structured storage.

6. **View Channel Statistics:**
    - After fetching, select a channel from the dropdown menu.
    - View detailed statistics for the selected channel, including viewership trends, engagement metrics, etc.

7. **Ask Questions About the Channel:**
    - In the dropdown menu, select from a list of predefined questions related to the channel.
    - The app will display answers and insights corresponding to the selected question.
